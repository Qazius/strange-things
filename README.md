#1 a typing bot in python (Typer Mimic)
- it types any text, somewhat realistically
- groups spaces into tabs, 
- consecutively repeated keys will be written fast; ++ (faster) vs += (delay between)
- words and spaces (sentences) are written fast
- customisable
  - delay and typing speed can be modified
  - additional keys (with custom delay) can be added

#2 a minecraft (bedrock) bot in python (Minecraft Target Bot)
- will turn towards the target (red colour, using a texture pack)
- perform an action when the target is in crosshair
- multiple actions
  - attack
  - shoot (bow)
  - break blocks
- customisable
  - margin of the target within crosshair before action is performed can be modified
  - sensitivity can be modified (for large and small targets)
- limitations
  - unviable for pvp (except maybe shooting)
  - no depth perception; does not move towards target
  - unable to control rotation smoothly using keyboard, affecting accuracy; requires full keyboard gameplay to be turned on in settings #for some reason, controlling the cursor does not rotate the screen
